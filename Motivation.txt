My motivation to follow The Odin Project curriculum is to learn about web development. 
I have taken math and computer science courses in university although I find they are not focused on
teaching the technical aspects of the programming like using git and version control systems. 
Along with other practical aspects of programming so to fill my gaps in my knowledge I have started this journey 
and The Odin Project seems to be the best way to go at this moment.
